# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The trained model can classify whether an MRI brain scan indicates the presence of a tumor or not.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🎯 **Objective**: Automatically classify brain MRI images as Tumor or No Tumor.
- 🧠 **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a public dataset.
- 🧪 **Accuracy**: Achieved ~90% accuracy on validation data.
- 🧾 **Application**: Helpful in early detection and decision support in medical diagnostics.

## 🧠 Model Workflow

1. MRI images are resized to 128x128 and normalized.
2. A CNN is trained to extract spatial features.
3. Final output layer predicts binary class: Tumor / No Tumor.
4. The model is saved as `cnn_model.h5`.
